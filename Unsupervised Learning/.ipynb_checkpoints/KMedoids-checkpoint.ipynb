    "1. Start with K random medoids\n",
    "2. Assign each data point one of the clusters depending upon their distance to the randomly choosen medoids\n",
    "3. Find/Update the new medoid, which is basically a replacement for the current medoid, unlike means which can simply be calculated this is a bit difficult\n",

    "### How can we find replacements for current medoids?\n",
    "We define a score, which is distance of each point in a cluster from the current medoid for each cluster.\n",
    "After which we do the same on the new medoid and if the score improves, we get a replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In better words, the replacement is found by: **Taking a random point from a cluster and checking if overall clustering cost is lesser than previous pointâ€™s cost**\n",

    "**Try Implementing in future**"
